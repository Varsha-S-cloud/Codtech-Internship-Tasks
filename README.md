## Task 1: Decision Tree Implementation
Built and visualized a Decision Tree model to classify or predict outcomes
using a structured dataset. The task demonstrates data preprocessing,
model training, visualization, and evaluation.

**Techniques Used:** Decision Tree Classifier, Model Visualization

---

## Task 2: Sentiment Analysis
Implemented a sentiment analysis system to classify user reviews into
positive or negative categories. Text data was converted into numerical
features using TF-IDF and classified using Logistic Regression.

**Techniques Used:** TF-IDF Vectorization, Logistic Regression

## Task 3: Image Classification using CNN
Developed an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). The model was trained on labeled image data to learn
visual patterns and perform accurate classification.

**Techniques Used:** Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Learning

---

## Task 4: Recommendation System
Built a recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques.
User-item interactions were analyzed to generate personalized
recommendations and evaluate performance using RMSE.

**Techniques Used:** Collaborative Filtering, Cosine Similarity
