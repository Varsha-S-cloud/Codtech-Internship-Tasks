# Task 1: Decision Tree Implementation

## Objective
To build and visualize a Decision Tree model using machine learning techniques
to classify or predict outcomes based on a given dataset.

## Dataset
A structured dataset containing input features and target labels was used.
The dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values and encoding
categorical variables where required.

## Methodology
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Performed data preprocessing
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Built a Decision Tree classifier using Scikit-learn
- Visualized the Decision Tree structure
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook format)

## Results
The Decision Tree model successfully learned patterns from the data and
provided accurate predictions. Visualization helped in understanding
the decision-making process of the model.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree algorithm
for classification and highlights its interpretability and effectiveness
in machine learning applications.
