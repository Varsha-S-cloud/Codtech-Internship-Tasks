# Task 2: Sentiment Analysis

## Objective
To build a sentiment analysis model that classifies user reviews as
positive or negative using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
A text-based dataset containing user-generated reviews and their
corresponding sentiment labels was used for training and evaluation.

## Methodology
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Performed text preprocessing
- Converted text data into numerical features using TF-IDF
- Trained a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics
- Tested the model with sample input text

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook format)

## Results
The model successfully learned sentiment patterns from textual data
and produced reliable predictions on unseen reviews.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to analyze
and classify sentiments from user reviews effectively.
