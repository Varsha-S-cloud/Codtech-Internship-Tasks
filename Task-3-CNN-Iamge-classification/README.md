# Task 3: Image Classification using CNN

## Objective
To build an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
to accurately classify images into predefined categories.

## Dataset
An image dataset containing labeled images across multiple classes was used.
The dataset was preprocessed by resizing images and normalizing pixel values.

## Methodology
- Loaded and preprocessed image data
- Designed a Convolutional Neural Network architecture
- Trained the CNN model on the training dataset
- Evaluated the model performance using accuracy
- Tested the model on sample images

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook format)

## Results
The CNN model was able to learn visual features from images and
achieved good classification accuracy.

## Conclusion
This task highlights the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks
in image classification problems and demonstrates practical deep learning usage.
